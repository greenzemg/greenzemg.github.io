Hi there! I'm Teklit Haphtu, a cybersecurity professional and software engineer with a passion to understand the underhood and the complexities of the digital world.

My interest with technology began during my bachelor's degree at Mekelle Institute of Technology (Ethiopia), where I was first introduced to the language of zeros and ones of electronic devices. Back then, fueled by a childhood dream of riches (through ethical hacking, of course!), I delved into the realm of cybersecurity in my first job as a security researcher and exploit developer.

While my time at INSA (Information Network Security Agency) honed my technical skills, I yearned for a deeper understanding of the industry. That's why I pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in cybersecurity at the University of Twente. This program, with its cutting-edge courses, helped me sharpen my knowledge and prepare for the ever-evolving threatscape.

Though I have a strong technical foundation, I recognized the value of practical experience. That's why I'm currently an Engineering Doctorate (EngD) trainee at Eindhoven University. This program is a perfect blend of academic rigor and industry exposure, allowing me to develop the professional skills I need to thrive in the real world.

Throughout my journey, these principles have been my compass:

-   **Keep it Simple:**  I strive for clear solutions and efficient approache.
-   **Automate Everything:** I like to automate everything I can, from home to office workflow.
-   **Plan and Organize**: I plan and organize all aspect of my life to ensure that I meet my goals.
-   **Discipline is key**: Maintaining consistent discipline in all endeavors.

<!-- When I'm not working, you can find me exploring the world of cybersecurity, reading the latest tech news, or enjoying a good book. I'm also a fitness enthusiast and a coffee lover, so you might find me at the gym or at a local coffee shop.  -->

In my spare time, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep both my mind and body engaged. I have passion for tennis ( Though not doing it enough), swimming, and soccer. I also participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, which are cybersecurity challenges, and I enjoy playing chess to sharpen my strategic thinking.
