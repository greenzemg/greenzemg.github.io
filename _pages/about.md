Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Cybersecurity Professional and Software Engineer with a passion for understanding the inner working of the digital world.

My interest with technology began during my bachelor's degree at Mekelle Institute of Technology (MIT- Ethiopia ), where I was first introduced the fundamental language of zeros and ones that power electronic devices. There, I studied computer, created programs, I tinkered electronics. 

<!-- Back then, fueled by a childhood dream of riches (through ethical hacking, of course!), I delved into the realm of cybersecurity in my first job as a security researcher and exploit developer. -->

After completing my degree, I worked in INSA (Information Network Security Agency) as a security researcher and exploit developer, where I honed my skills in cybersecurity. Then, In 2021, I received scholarship and I pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in cybersecurity at the University of Twente. This program, with its cutting-edge courses, helped me sharpen my knowledge and prepare for the ever-evolving threatscape.

Though I have a strong technical foundation, I recognized the value of practical experience on professional setting. That's why I'm currently following Engineering Doctorate (EngD) program at Eindhoven University. This program is a perfect blend of academic rigor and industry exposure, allowing me to develop the professional skills I need to thrive in the real world.

Throughout my journey, these principles have been my compass:

> -   **Keep it Simple:** Clear solutions and efficient approach.
> -   **Automate Everything:** I like to automate everything I can, from home to office workflow.
> -   **Plan and Organize**: I do my best to plan and organize all aspect of my life to ensure that I meet my goals.
> -   **Discipline is key**: Discipline is my anchor to stay focused and persistent.

<!-- When I'm not working, you can find me exploring the world of cybersecurity, reading the latest tech news, or enjoying a good book. I'm also a fitness enthusiast and a coffee lover, so you might find me at the gym or at a local coffee shop.  -->

Have I time? then you will find me enjoying activities that keep both my mind and body engaged. I have passion for tennis ( Though not doing it enough), swimming, and soccer. I also participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, which are cybersecurity challenges, and I enjoy playing chess to sharpen my strategic thinking.
