#### What is the research about?

Digital Twins are virtual representations of physical objects, systems, or processes. They serve as dynamic, real-time counterparts to physical assets, offering insights and predictive capabilities across various industrial domains. In addition, in the context of Industry 4.0, Digital Twins are playing a vital role in enhancing the security of overall operation with out causing disruption.

#### Key findings:

<ul>
    <li>By analyzing 67 research papers published between 2018 and 2023, we explored the growing importance of digital twins in ensuring data security in Industry 4.0.</li>
    <li>Our findings highlight how digital twins, combined with technologies like machine learning and blockchain, can address cybersecurity challenges in Industry 4.0.</li>
</ul>

<!-- On the behalf of the team, I am thrilled to announce the acceptance of our research paper, "Systematic Literature Review: Digital Twins' role in Enhancing Security for Industry 4.0 Applications" in the esteemed Security and Privacy Journal. -->
