My Master's graduation project (2nd par of my M.Sc thesis) under supervision of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammed-elhajj-0b88b0156/"> Mohammed Elhajj </a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taru-itapelto/" >Taru It√§pelto</a> titled 'Enhancing Resilience in Digital Twins ASCON-Based Security Solutions for Industry 4.0' has been accepted by esteemed Network Journal. I am excited to announce it! :rocket: :smile: :tada:

### **Enhancing Security in Industry 4.0 with ASCON: A Breakthrough in IoT and Digital Twin Integration**


In the world of Industry 4.0, where machines talk to each other and digital twins mirror real-world processes, security is a big deal. Traditional security methods often struggle to keep up with the demands of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which are smaller and less powerful than regular computers.

That's where ASCON comes in. It's a new type of encryption algorithm designed specifically for IoT devices. ASCON helps protect data as it travels between digital twins and IoT devices. This means that sensitive information stays safe and secure, even when it's being sent over the internet.

Our research shows that ASCON is much better than older methods like AES-GCM. It's faster, uses less energy, and takes up less space on IoT devices. This is important because IoT devices have limited resources. 

**So, what does this mean for industries like manufacturing and energy?** It means they can protect their critical systems from cyberattacks. By using ASCON, they can ensure that their digital twins and IoT devices are safe and reliable.

**Looking ahead,** there's even more potential for ASCON. We can make it work even better on specific types of microprocessors. And we can develop new ways to securely access remote systems in Industry 4.0 environments. As more and more industries adopt digital technology, ASCON will play a key role in keeping their operations safe and secure.
